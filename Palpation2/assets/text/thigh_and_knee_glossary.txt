Tibiofemoral joint
the anatomical name for the knee joint

*Ligament Terminology
Anterior cruciate ligament
a ligament that runs from the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia to the posterior inner aspect of lateral femoral condyle, often injured in hyperextention or hyper rotation of the knee

Posterior cruciate ligament
a ligament that runs from the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia to the inner surface of the medial condyle
Tibial collateral ligament
a ligament that runs from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the proximal medial tibia

*Muscle Terminology
Antagonist
a muscle that opposes the action of a reference muscle
Biceps femoris long head
the lateral hamstring that originates on the ischial tuberosity and inserts on the head of the fibula
Biceps femoris short head
the lateral hamstring that attaches to the middle linea aspera and joins the long head near the knee joint
Fiber Direction
the arrangement of the striations of a muscle
Gracilis
a long slender muscle on the medial thigh, originates on the inferior pubic ramus and inserts on the pes anserinus on the proximal medial tibia
Insertion
the more moveable muscle attachment site on a bone
Isometric muscle contraction 
a muscle contraction that does not cause joint movement
Muscle bellies
the fleshy center of the muscle
Muscular health 
the condition or state of a muscle
Origin
the more stationary muscle attachment site on a bone
Palpable findings 
the practitioner’s felt sensation of a muscle, soft tissue or structure of the body 
Palpate 
to evaluate by touch
Palpation 
the act of using one's hands to examine, locate and manipulate a muscle, soft tissue or structure of the body
Pes anserinus
a wide tendinous attachment of gracilis, sartorius, semitendinosus on the proximal medial tibia, “goose foot”
Rectus femoris 
the superficial head of the quadriceps femoris, originates on the anterior inferior iliac spine and joins the quadriceps tendon
Sartorius
a long muscle crossing the anterior thigh from the lateral to medial, originates on the (ASIS) and inserts on the pes anserinus of the tibia, considered to be the longest muscle in the human body
Semimembranosus
one of the medial hamstrings, originates on the ischial tuberosity and inserts on the posterior medial tibial condyle, deep to the semitendinosus
Semitendinosus
one of the medial hamstrings, originates on the ischial tuberosity and inserts on the pes anserinus
Vastus Intermedius
the deep head of the quadriceps, originates on the anterior lateral femur and joins the quadriceps tendon
Vastus lateralis
the lateral head of the quadriceps originates on the linea aspera and posterior septum of femur and joins the quadriceps tendon
Vastus medialis
the medial head of the quadriceps originates on the medial femur and joins the quadriceps tendon

*Movement Terminology
Action
the movement created by a muscle contraction at a given joint
Actively 
when the client performs a movement unassisted
Extension 
an anterior movement of the tibia in the sagittal plane
Flexion 
a posterior movement of the tibia in the sagittal plane
Lateral rotation 
the rotation of the anterior surface of the tibia away from the midline of the body
Medial rotation
the rotation of the anterior surface of the tibia towards the midline of the body
Passively 
when the client remains inactive
