Superior fibular retinaculum
runs from the calcaneus vertically to the lateral malleolus, encloses the tendons of peroneus longus and brevis

*Movement Terminology
Antagonist
a muscle that opposes the action of another muscle
Body mechanics
the body’s positioning and alignment when performing a physical task like palpating a muscle or applying a manual technique
Dorsiflexion
movement of the dorsal surface of the foot towards the shin in the sagittal plane (extension)
Eversion
movement at the intertarsal joints facing the plantar surface of the foot laterally
Extension
movement of the dorsal surface of the foot towards the shin in the sagittal plane (dorsiflexion)
Flexion
movement of the plantar surface of the foot away from the shin in the sagittal plane (plantarflexion)
Isometric muscle contraction
a muscle contraction without joint movement
Plantar flexion
movement of the plantar surface of the foot away from the shin in the sagittal plane (flexion)

*Muscle Terminology
Deep posterior compartment
